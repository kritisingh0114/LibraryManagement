# LibraryManagement

CS520 Final Project

## Description
Our project is a library management system. Within this system, we plan to have different views for a librarian or user (‘patrons’ at the library). The goal is to create an organized system of handling transactions (borrowing and returns) in the library, one that enables easy validation and auditing of library material. For example, it enables both the librarians and the users to view the catalog of books, and determine which of them are still available on the shelves. It also allows users to see which books they have borrowed by and when. The librarians will be able to view the latter for every user.
The importance of having a digitized system for library management, or any digitized management system for that matter would be to help with organization and efficiency. With this system, the librarian does not need to keep track of ledgers of records. With a few clicks of a button a librarian can see who last checked out a book, how long ago it was checked out, what books the library currently has, which books are overdue, etc. This would also allow the user to better keep track of the books they have borrowed. The user can now easily see which books they have currently checked out and for how much longer they can keep a book before it becomes overdue. Additionally they can search the database for where in the library a book is located, whether the book they are looking for is available or not, etc. In terms of efficiency, if the library did not use a digitized management system, this would mean that they would have to organize their data a different way, which would most likely mean writing everything down on paper or having to manage spreadsheets containing this information. Digitizing a library management system would allow both librarians and users to have access to the database, albeit in slightly different ways, and reduce the amount of effort needed to ensure accurate organization of library material. It also allows real-time updates to be reflected to both parties.
